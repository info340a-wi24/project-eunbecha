### Problem / Data Domain

With an abundance of music streaming services and its prevalence of use during today's day and age, it is important that users are satisfied with what
streaming platforms have to offer. However, issues such as poor collaborative listening features and an unavailability of songs are things that have yet to be dealt with.
In its current landscape, collaborative music consumption doesn't have a lot of great options. Existing systems (e.g. [Spotify Jam](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/jam/)) are "janky" and hard to navigate, thus discouraging the experience of listening to music with friends. Furthermore, music distribution is often
not consistent throughout multiple different platforms due to a multitude of factors. Sometimes artists wonâ€™t push to specific distribution platforms
due to copyright etc.. leading listeners to oftentimes have to visit 2-3 sites just to enjoy the music they like.

Our solution to this problem is to create a collaborative playlist webapp that allows multiple people to seamlessly queue music, and the ability to add songs
from multiple different platforms.
