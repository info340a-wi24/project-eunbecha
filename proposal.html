            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
            <p>
                In its current landscape, collaborative music consumption doesn't have a lot of great options. Existing systems (e.g. 
                <cite><a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/jam/">Spotify Jam</a></cite>) 
                are "janky" and hard to navigate, thus discouraging the experience of listening to music with friends. Furthermore, music distribution is often 
                not consistent throughout multiple different platforms due to a multitude of factors. Sometimes artists wonâ€™t push to specific distribution platforms 
                due to copyright etc.. leading listeners to oftentimes have to visit 2-3 sites just to enjoy the music they like.
            </p>    
            <p>
                Our solution to this problem is to create a collaborative playlist webapp that allows multiple people to seamlessly queue music, and the ability to add songs 
                from multiple different platforms.</p>

                With the features of our application, we hope to resolve the issues that music enjoyers might have from other
                streaming platforms. With our application, not only will people be able to have a better experience sharing music
                with others, but all sharing activities will be located in one place. Additionally, people will find it very useful
                to find all music in our application. Since some music is exclusive to a streaming service, users will enjoy
                being able to ignore that exclusivity and experience a cross-platform music streaming service.
