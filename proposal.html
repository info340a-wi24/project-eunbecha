        <p>
            In its current landscape, collaborative music consumption doesn;t have a lot of great options. Existing systems (e.g. Spotify Jam) 
            are "janky" and hard to navigate, thus discouraging the experience of listening to music with friends. Furthermore, music distribution is often 
            not consistent throughout multiple different platforms due to a multitude of factors. Sometimes artists wonâ€™t push to specific distribution platforms 
            due to copyright etc.. leading listeners to oftentimes have to visit 2-3 sites just to enjoy the music they like.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our solution to this problem is to create a collaborative playlist webapp that allows multiple people to seamlessly queue music, and the ability to add songs 
            from multiple different platforms.</p>
