        <p>4. With the features of our application, we hope to resolve the issues that music enjoyers might have from other
            streaming platforms. With our application, not only will people be able to have a better experience sharing music
            with others, but all sharing activities will be located in one place. Additionally, people will find it very useful
            to find all music in our application. Since some music is exclusive to a streaming service, users will enjoy
            being able to ignore that exclusivity and experience a cross-platform music streaming service.
